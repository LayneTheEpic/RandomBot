# RandomBot

Eventually going to be some kind of generic do-it-all discord bot. For now I'm just messing around though



yes i am aware that this is really shitty and the file system calls are complete ass
im trying ok



todo:
- factor each command to a class
	- uhh command descriptions? for use with --help
		- could use a utility embed class for all embeds
	- spamPing needs a queue
